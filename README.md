# ML_Models on Drug Consumption Dataset

Machine learning involves building mathematical models to help understand the data. Rightly said this “Drug Consumption Dataset” had a variety of hidden features inside it and I have managed to analyze some of the features of it. Every time I build a model and get results, I would have a new dimension on the perspective of the dataset. It involves many features having considered ten features after the feature selection process and then pre-processing the output variables to a binary classification problem, splitting them to training and test data, then passing data through the classifier, obtaining results and performing analysis on the performance metrics was the challenging aspect of the given problem statement. 

Results obtained by applying various models and calculating their Accuracy, Precision, Specificity, Sensitivity, Confusion Matrix, ROC and the AUC we can determine which is the best classifier to use. For my analysis I took six drugs namely Benzos, LSD, Meth, Nicotine, Cocaine and VSA to predict the people surveyed as Users or Non-Users of the drugs.
